# Credit Card Fraud Detection – EDA

## Project Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of credit-card transactions to identify patterns that help detect fraud.

## Structure
- `notebooks/` – EDA notebooks  
- `src/` – reusable code (e.g., GroupRanker)  
- `reports/` – Learning Tracker and exported plots  
- `data/` – (local dataset, ignored on GitHub)

## Next Steps
1. Continue EDA (Amount + Class)  
2. Add time-based analysis  
3. Document insights and upload plots
